# Stack
### Built out a Stack class that can:
### - Add a new item to the top using .push()
### - Remove an item from the top and return its value using .pop()
### - Return the value of the top item using .peek()
### - Maintain awareness of overflow and underflow using this.size and this.maxSize

### I've also created a class called PizzaDelivery.java that stacks up pizza for delivery. Once there are 5 pizzas in the deliveryGal stack, additional pizzas are stacked onto the pizzaHouse stack.
### .assign(): this method assigns pizzas to the appropriate stack.
### .deliver(): this method removes pizzas from the deliveryGal stack.
